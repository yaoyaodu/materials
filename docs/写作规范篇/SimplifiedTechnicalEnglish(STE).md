# 2.   Noun Clusters, Articles and Demonstrative Adjectives

Summary of the rules

**Noun clusters**

- Rule 2.1 Write noun clusters of **no more than three words**.

- Rule 2.2 When a technical name has more than three words, write it in full. Then you can simplify it as follows:
  - Give a shorter name
  - Use hyphens between words that are used as a single unit.

**Articles and demonstrative adjectives**

- Rule 2.3 When applicable, use an article (the, a, an) or a demonstrative adjective (this, these, this, that, these, those, such, same...) before a noun.
  - Articles and demonstrative adjectives show where nouns and noun phrases are. Use articles and demonstrative adjectives correctly and do not omit them to make the text shorter.
  - It is not always correct English to put an article before a noun. Do not use articles in general statements.
  - In short sentences, it can be clearer to include all the articles before the nouns. But sentences that contain a long series of items are clearer when you do not repeat the articles.
    - Example: Install the nuts (2) and the bolts (3).
    - Example: Discard the packings (3), gaskets (4), seals (7) and washers (9). 
  - Also, a definite article is incorrect before a noun when an alphanumeric identifier (字母数字标识符) comes after it.
    - Incorrect: Tag the circuit breaker 36L7.
    - CORRECT: Tag circuit breaker 36L7.

 

# 3.  Verbs

**Forms and tenses of verbs**

- Rule 3.1 Use only those forms of the verb that are given in the dictionary.
- Rule 3.2 Use the approved forms of the verb to make only:
  -  The infinitive
  -  The imperative (command form)
  - The simple present tense
  -  The simple past tense
  -  The past participle (as an adjective)
  - The future tense.
- Rule 3.3 Use the past participle only as an adjective. 
  - When you use the past participle as an adjective, it describes the condition of something. This is not passive voice.
- Rule 3.4 Do not use helping verbs to make complex verb structures.
- Rule 3.5 Use the “-ing” form of a verb only as a modifier in a technical name.




**Active voice**

- Rule 3.6 Use only the active voice in procedural writing. Use the active voice as much as possible in descriptive writing.


**How to describe an action**

- Rule 3.7 Use an approved verb to describe an action (not a noun or other parts of speech).




# 4.  Sentences

**Short sentences and simple sentence structure**

- Rule 4.1 Write short and clear sentences.

- Rule 4.2 Do not omit words or use contractions to make your sentences shorter.
  - Each sentence must have all its parts. Do not omit words or use contractions (for example, don’t, isn’t, aren’t) when you write sentences. If you do that, your sentence will be shorter but it will not be easier to read. Write all words in full.

- Rule 4.3 Use a vertical list for complex texts. 

**Connecting words and phrases**

- Rule 4.4 Use connecting words and phrases to connect sentences that contain related topics.
  - Connecting words are words or phrases that connect a topic in one sentence with an idea in a sentence that follows. In descriptive text, they help you to **structure a text logically and give information in a way that is easy to understand.** Some approved connecting words are “**and**”, “**but**”, “**then**”, and “**thus**”. “**As a result**” is an approved connecting phrase.

 

# 5. Procedural Writing

**Sentences**

- Rule 5.1 Write short sentences. Use **a maximum of 20 words** in each sentence.

- Rule 5.2 Write only one instruction in each sentence unless two or more actions occur at the same time.

**Verbs**

- Rule 5.3 Write instructions in the imperative (command) form.

**Descriptive statements in instructions**

- Rule 5.4 If you start an instruction with a descriptive statement (dependent phrase or clause), divide that statement from the command with a comma.

**Notes**

- Rule 5.5 Write **notes** only to **give information, not instructions**.




# 6. Descriptive Writing

**Content structure**

- Rule 6.1 Give information gradually.
  - In a descriptive text, give information gradually and make sure that each sentence contains only one topic. If you give too much information too quickly, your text will be difficult to understand and it will be necessary for the reader to read it again.

- Rule 6.2 Use key words and phrases to organize your text logically.

  - **Key words and phrases give structure to a text.** Key words are words that often occur in a text to connect different ideas. Key phrases have the same function. Such words and phrases show how information in a text is related and give the text a logical structure. 

  - You can also use connecting words and phrases to help the reader understand the progression of ideas in the text. They function as traffic signs and tell the reader if the information is new, or different, or a conclusion based on preceding facts. 

    Examples of such connecting words and phrases are: “and”, “but”, “thus”, “at the same time”, “as a result”, and many others.

**Sentences**

- Rule 6.3 Write short sentences. Use **a maximum of 25 words** in each sentence.

**Paragraphs**

- Rule 6.4 Use paragraphs to show **related information**.
  - In procedures, work steps have numbers and letters to show their sequence. In descriptive writing, paragraphs keep related information together and organize the text into a logical sequence.
  - In STE, a paragraph starts with a “topic sentence” which tells the reader what the topic of that paragraph is. Then, the sentences that follow the topic sentence explain it or give additional information to support it.
  - When a new paragraph starts, the reader knows that there will be new or different information in that paragraph.

- Rule 6.5 Make sure that each paragraph has **only one topic**.

- Rule 6.6 Make sure that no paragraph has more than six sentences.


# 7.  Safety Instructions

**Definitions**

- A **warning** tells the reader that there is a risk of **injury or death**.

- A **caution** tells the reader that there is a risk of **damage to objects**.


**How to write safety instructions**

- Rule 7.1  Use an applicable word (for example, “warning” or “caution”) to identify the level of risk.
  - Do an accurate risk analysis to decide if there is a risk of injury or death to persons (warning), or if there is a risk of damage to machines, tools or equipment (caution), or both.

- Rule 7.2  **Start a safety instruction with a clear and simple command or condition**.

  - Start a safety instruction with a clear and simple command or condition. **Your reader must know what to do to prevent accidents and keep a high level of safety.**

  - If your reader must know about a specific condition before the start of a procedure or work step, give this condition first.


- Rule 7.3  Give an explanation to show the specific risk or possible result.


  - If possible, **always tell your reader what can occur if the safety instruction is not obeyed.** If the danger is clearly specified, the person who does the task will understand the risk and be more careful.


# 8.   Punctuation and Word Count

**Punctuation**

- Rule 8.1 You can use all standard English punctuation marks except the semicolon (;).

- Rule 8.2 **Use hyphens (-) to connect closely related words.**

- Rule 8.3 You can use parentheses:
  - **To make references to illustrations or text**
    - Remove the valve (10, Figure 1)
    - Install the cover (refer to paragraphs 2 thru 5)
  - To include letters or numbers that identify items on an illustration or in text
  - To identify the steps in a procedure
  - To include abbreviations
  - To give the singular and plural forms of a noun at the same time
  - To explain words or a part of a sentence
  - To include an alternative.

**Word count**

- Rule 8.4  In a vertical list, a colon (:) has the same effect on word count as a full stop (period) and shows the end of a sentence.

- Rule 8.5  **When you put text in parentheses** it counts as one word in that sentence.

- Rule 8.6  Count each of these as one word:
  - Numbers
  - Units of measurement
  - Abbreviations
  - Alphanumeric identifiers
  - Quoted text
  - Titles, headings, and placards

- Rule 8.7 Hyphenated words count as one word.


# 9.  Writing Practices

**Different sentence constructions**

- Rule 9.1 Use a different construction to write a sentence when a word-for-word replacement is not sufficient.

**Correct use of approved words**

- Rule 9.2 Use each approved word correctly.
- Rule 9.3 When you use two words together, do not make phrasal verbs.
  - Incorrect: This compound can give off poisonous fumes. 
  - Correct: This compound can release poisonous fumes.

**Consistent style**

- Rule 9.4 When you select terminology or wording, always use a consistent style.

**General recommendations**

- GR-1 The conjunction “that”
  - Do not write: Make sure the valve is open.
  - Write: Make sure that the valve is open.
- GR-2 The preposition “with”: This word can sometimes cause ambiguity.
  - In STE, the preposition “with” has three approved meanings. It is a function word that shows 
    - “association or relationship”
    - “help or sharing”
    - “a means or instrument”
  - Example:
    - Do not write: Carefully seal the opening with the specified tool.
    - Write: Use the specified tool to seal the opening.
- GR-3 How to use pronouns
  - If a pronoun can refer to one or more nouns in a text, it can make a sentence ambiguous. If a sentence is ambiguous, replace the pronoun with the word that it refers to. This will make the sentence clear and easier to read.
- GR-4 The pronoun “this”
  - If “this” can refer to more than one thing, describe the applicable context again.
